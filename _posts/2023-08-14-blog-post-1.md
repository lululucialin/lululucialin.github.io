I analysed helpdesk ticket data with topic modelling to uncover the most common student questions. This ensured our FAQs stayed relevant, written in student language, and saved staff time from repetitive queries.

Problem
======
Having an up-to-date FAQ on the university website saves students from asking repeat questions and staff from answering them again and again. In this project, my goal was to review our department FAQs to make sure they were current, relevant, and written in language students actually use.

Method
======
Instead of relying on memory or assumptions, I analysed helpdesk support ticket data to identify the most common questions and themes. By applying a text analysis method called topic modelling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to be exact), I was able to discover patterns and themes in a large amount of text-based documents (in this case, our support tickets). This allowed us to 3 key topics that came up most often and where our existing FAQs had gaps.

Impact
======
This approach allows me to identify what topic, and specific questions we can include so that ensure our FAQs reflect genuine student needs and used language that resonates with patrons. It also saves us time to review existing tickets manually.
