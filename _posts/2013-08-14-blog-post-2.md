This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

Problem
======
Having an up-to-date FAQ on the university website saves students from asking repeat questions and staff from answering them again and again. In this project, my goal was to review our department FAQs to make sure they were current, relevant, and written in language students actually use.

Method
======
Instead of relying on memory or assumptions, I analysed helpdesk support ticket data to identify the most common questions and themes. By applying text analysis method called topic modelling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation to be exact), I was able to discover pattern and theme in large amount of text based document (in which case our support tickets) could see which topic came up most often and where our existing FAQs had gaps.

Impact
======
This approach allow me to identify what topic, and sepecific questions we can include so that ensured our FAQs reflected genuine student needs and used language that resonated with patrons. It also save us time to review manual reviewing for staff.
