The GOBI Holdings Automation project shows how basic coding knowledge, combined with GPT, can automate repetitive tasks, reduce manual processing, and create a workflow that even non-technical staff can use.

Problem
======
GOBI (a well-known library book supplier) has automatic duplication detection for eBooks and physical books. To enable duplication detection and make sure our library holdings stay up to date in the GOBI system, we need to supply a list of current holdings to them. In this project, I aim to automate the process of getting a clean, verified set of ISBNs for current library resources that can be sent to GOBI, as well as creating a procedure that can be redone by anyone.

Method
======
This project is one of the very first projects I coded using Chat-GPT. With a basic understanding of Python and the Python module ‘isbnlib’, I decided it would be faster to have GPT write code using my script logic than writing the code myself (which would mean hours on Stack Overflow, figuring out what I did wrong, or even worse, trying to find the right wording for my questions). I knew what the script should do, so I wrote logic that tells GPT what I want.

**Manual ISBN Verification Workflow**  
Below is the step-by-step logic for verifying ISBNs if done manually:

1. Prompt the user to select a CSV file using a pop-up window.  
2. If no file is selected, exit the program.  
3. Open the selected CSV file for reading and create an output file named `YBP_HOLDINGS.TXT`.  
4. Parse the CSV file and iterate through each row.  
5. For each ISBN in the row, remove any spacing.  
6. Check the validity of the ISBN using a strict level validation.  
7. If the ISBN is invalid, move to the next ISBN in the row.  
8. If the ISBN is valid, convert it to a 13-digit format.  
9. Write the ISBN along with a specified account code to the output file.  
10. Close the output file once all ISBNs have been processed.  
11. Display a message box indicating completion with the message **“Done.”**

I’m also a firm believer that if the process can’t be replicated by someone else, it isn’t finished—so I created a step-by-step procedure that even non-technical staff can follow.

Impact
------
This process allowed me to generate a list of validated ISBNs almost instantly, compared to the hours it would take manually. It improved data accuracy by ensuring only properly formatted ISBNs were supplied to GOBI, enabling reliable duplication detection. Most importantly, I documented the workflow so that non-technical staff could run the process themselves, making it a sustainable solution beyond just my own use.
