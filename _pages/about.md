üìö I'm a Discovery and Metadata Librarian working at a university in Sydney for over 10 years. I have an MS in Commerce majoring in data analytics and information system, and BA in Communication 

About my work
======
üìä I enjoy applying my data analytics skills to everyday work in the library. I'm particularly interested in library analytics ‚Äî whether it's coding, building predictive models, or designing dashboards, I love using data to solve problems and support strategic decisions 

üåü As an academic library practitioner, I've also led and participated in numerous projects relating to information discovery, library systems and metadata management. 

From Libraries to Data
------
**Data Analytics is a perfect fit for my technical and visual brain.** I enjoyed art when I was younger and ended up studying Communication and started my career in an academic library. I grew interested in the technical stuff and self-taught myself how to code. Eventually, I enrolled in an MS in Data Analytics in 2018, and it was the best decision I made.

While my current title isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdata analyst,‚Äù I see myself as one. I regularly apply what I‚Äôve learned to my work, using data to solve problems, improve processes, and make decisions. Check out some of the library projects I‚Äôve worked on !

I‚Äôve also taken on several data projects in my spare time. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you‚Äôd like to collaborate

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
