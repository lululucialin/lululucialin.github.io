ðŸ“š I'm a Discovery and Metadata Librarian working at a university in Sydney for over 10 years. I have an MS in Commerce majoring in data analytics and information system, and BA in Communication 

About my work
======
ðŸ“Š I enjoy applying my data analytics skills to everyday work in the library. I'm particularly interested in library analytics â€” whether it's coding, building predictive models, or designing dashboards, I love using data to solve problems and support strategic decisions 

ðŸŒŸ As an academic library practitioner, I've also led and participated in numerous projects relating to information discovery, library systems and metadata management. 

From Libraries to Data
------
My journey began as a casual shelver at my local public library, which sparked my interest in the field and led me to pursue a career in academic libraries. Over time, I became increasingly drawn to the technical side and taught myself how to code. With a naturally visual and analytical mind, data analytics felt like the perfect fit â€” so I completed a Master in Data Analytics in 2018 while working full time.

I approach every project with a data-driven, analytical mindset â€” whether itâ€™s solving problems, streamlining workflows, or supporting smarter decision-making, both in my day job and through independent projects.

Take a look at some of the library projects and personal data portfolios Iâ€™ve worked on. If youâ€™re interested in collaborating, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!

Outside of work, youâ€™ll often find me dancing ðŸ’ƒ or drawing ðŸŽ¨.
