📚 I'm a Discovery and Metadata Librarian working at a university in Sydney for over 10 years. I have an MS in Commerce majoring in data analytics and information system, and BA in Communication 

About my work
======
📊 I enjoy applying my data analytics skills to everyday work in the library. I'm particularly interested in library analytics — whether it's coding, building predictive models, or designing dashboards, I love using data to solve problems and support strategic decisions 

🌟 As an academic library practitioner, I've also led and participated in numerous projects relating to information discovery, library systems and metadata management. 

From Libraries to Data
------
I’ve always had a visual and analytical mind. My journey began with a love for art, which led me to study Communication and work in an academic library. Over time, I became increasingly drawn to the technical side of things and taught myself to code — eventually completing a Master’s in Data Analytics in 2018.

I approach project with a data-driven, analytical mindset — whether it’s solving problems, streamlining workflows, or supporting smarter decision-making, both in my day job and through independent projects.

Take a look at some of the library project and personal data portfolios. If you’re interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
